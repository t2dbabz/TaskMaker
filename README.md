# TaskMaker
This is an android project developed in order to practice and prepare for the Google Associate Android Developer Exam (AAD).<br>
I tried to implement most of the topics in the [Study guide](https://developers.google.com/certification/associate-android-developer/study-guide) and
I used the Exam past question in this [article](https://medium.com/@suyoggunjal/google-certified-android-developer-59af40bae846) as the basis for this project. 

## Topics 
- UI â€” (Constraint Layout etc.)
- Widgets like Checkbox, Time Picker and Date Picker
- RecyclerView, Pagination Library
- Menu 
- LiveData and ViewModel
- Activity, Fragment Transactions
- MVVM Architecture (Repository Pattern)
- Room Database, Sorting Query
- Notifications (In-App)
- Alarm Manager and Work Manager
- Shared Preferences and Settings Preferences 
- App Settings for light and dark theme
- Debugging
- Unit Test Cases and UI Test Cases (Espresso)

## Prerequisite
